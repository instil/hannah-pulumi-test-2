- Don’t forget the back button.
- Don’t design the app UI
- - Use general terms.
- - Do not refer to user interface elements, these might change, and the tests should still work.
- Consider results that aren’t apparent in the UI
- - If data can be entered what are the limitations?
- - - If it’s a date, how far in the future or past?
- - - if it’s a type of data, are we checking to make sure it’s valid? Such as a number, email, text, etc.
- - How many times can something be attempted?
